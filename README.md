Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

Hi there,

Thanks for taking the time to go through my website.

This website highlights some of the places I visited and the work that I did at my internship. I talk about my time at the Golden Gate Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, and OmniVirt, which was where I interned for the summer.

I'll go through what's contained in each file below:

1. bridge.html: This file contains my experience at the Golden Gate Bridge. It uses Bootstrap's grid model to divide the layout into two columns: Left column for pictures (bridge.jpg and bridge1.jpg) and right column for text. I also incorporated Bootstrap's button features to allow users to go back to the homepage (index.html) or any of the other two pages.

2. index.html: This file contains the homepage of the website. It contains a brief introduction of what the website is about and utilizes a Bootstrap list to provide users access to the rest of the site.

3. omnivirt.html: This file contains my experience at OmniVirt, my summer work place. It utilizes a Bootstrap table to highlight my work at the internship and display text and a picture (millbrae.jpg) as well. Bootstrap's button features were incorporated to allow users to go back to the homepage (index.html) or any of the other two pages.

4. park.html: This file contains my experience at the Golden Gate Park. Like bridge.html, it uses Bootstrap's grid model to divide the layout into two columns: Left column for pictures (park.jpg) and right column for text. I also incorporated Bootstrap's button features to allow users to go back to the homepage (index.html) or any of the other two pages.

5. README.md: This file is the file you are reading. It describes the project and all the various files.

6. style.css: This is my stylesheet. It has the following elements .table, #locations, body, header, main, and footer (total: 6 elements) using the following CSS properties: background-color, color, text-align, font-size, padding, and margin-left (total: 6 CSS properties).

Thanks for your time and help, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best,
Sung
