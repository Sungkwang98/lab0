                    Over the summer, I was able to be a proper tourist of San Francisco.
                    In other words, I immediately went and only saw the Golden Gate Bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just kidding :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also went to the Golden Gate <i>Park</i>...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anywhoot, I was really lucky when I went to the Golden Gate <b>Bridge</b>
                    because the sky was clear (Buh bye Karl the fog) and the sun was shining.
                    So naturally, my friend and I did a little photo shoot on the bridge.

                  After, we ordered Chinese food via UberEats and stuck around to watch the sunset.
                  It was beautiful, but it was also frigid.
                  And then the Muni, the public tranportation system, failed us by not showing up for 1.5 hours.
