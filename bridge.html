              Over the summer, I was able to be a proper tourist of San Francisco.
              In other words, I immediately went and only saw the Golden Gate Bridge.
          </p>
          <p>
              Just kidding :)
          </p>
          <p>
              I also went to the Golden Gate <i>Park</i>...
          </p>
          <p>
              Anywhoot, I was really lucky when I went to the Golden Gate <b>Bridge</b>
              because the sky was clear (Buh bye Karl the fog) and the sun was shining.
              So naturally, my friend and I did a little photo shoot and stayed to watch the sunset
              (Note the pictures).
