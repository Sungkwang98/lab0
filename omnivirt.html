              Despite all the fun I was having being a tourist, I was actually in San Francisco for work.
              I was hired as a Product Marketing Intern at OmniVirt, an advertisement tech start-up based in beautiful Millbrae.

                Beautiful Millbrae: I walked by this beautiful house and its palm trees and antique cars on my way to work!

              While there, I got to dabble in a bit of all sorts of work and learned a tremendous deal of marketing, growth hacking, and business development.
              See the table below to see what my work exactly entailed.

                    This helped our team send out email blasts faster and more efficiently.
