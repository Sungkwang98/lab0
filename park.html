                      During my time in San Francisco, I made sure to check out any places that had the words "Golden Gate" in them.
                      So the weekend after visiting the Bridge, my friends and I planned a visit to Golden Gate Park.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There, we learned that Golden Gate referred to that small sliver of water that allowed ships to get past the peninsula on which SF is situated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was a lovely time, especially because the weather, once again, cooperated with us.
                    We spent a good 5 hours going around the park on Uber/Lyft electric bikes.
                    I wished I had a picture of me riding the bikes, but alas, that would have been dangerous.
                  </p>

                      (Note my friend Alex in the background.
                      We tried to get him to move but he couldn't hear us...
                      Alas, a potential LinkedIn profile picture wasted.)
